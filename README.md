## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It is I, DairyProducts! I'm a first-year computer engineering major at UC San Diego, from the San Francisco Bay Area. My GitHub profile has a bunch of wonky, old, possibly defective code I wrote when learning how to program. Some of it is half-decent code (if I do say so myself) I wrote for some bigger, more polished projects I worked on.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **surviving my first year of university**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **data structures and data science**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **why the F-22 Raptor is the superior fifth generation fighter**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **Discord @&nbsp;** `Dairy#6166`
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **he/him**
- âš¡ Fun fact: **As of writing, I haven't showered in 26 hours. I promise I have a valid reason.**

<!--
**DairyProducts/DairyProducts** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
