## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It is I, DairyProducts! I'm a high school senior in the San Francisco Bay Area. My GitHub profile has a bunch of wonky, old, possibly defective code I wrote when learning how to program. Some of it is half-decent code (if I do say so myself) I wrote for some bigger projects I worked on.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **surviving my last year of high school**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **web development basics**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **why the F-22 Raptor is the superior fifth generation fighter**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **Discord @&nbsp;** `Dairy#6166`
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **he/him**
- âš¡ Fun fact: **I currently have an empty Diet Snapple bottle and two empty VitaminWater bottles strewn on my desk I am yet to thrown away**

<!--
**DairyProducts/DairyProducts** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
